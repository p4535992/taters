## <b>Inspiration Points</b>

Inspiration Points are earned by the whole party of players.

The party can earn up to 3 points per session and store points up to the number of players in the group. 
The party must agree when and how to spend the Inspiration Points.

The party earns Inspiration Points at the end of session with:

- great roleplaying moments, deep storytelling with dramatic effect, rich detail in describing combat, or having appropriate fun
- working together as a team to overcome extraordinary odds, defeating difficult opponents, and progressing the story when it is not openly directed by the DM
- not having excessive small talk or phone use on the table (other than RP aids), actively listening or engaging with the DM, not distracting from the atmosphere of the game

The party may spend an Inspiration Point anytime to:

- increase one player’s Initiative by +10 for one combat
- regain one use for an ability that recovers with short rest
- remove one failed Death Save or Injury Token
- turn one already rolled Attack or Skill check by a player or DM into a failure or success. If a failure is turned into success, it is a partial success that may carry complications. Saves and Death Saves cannot be affected.
- have the DM roll twice when rolling on a random effect table and the party chooses one of the possible results
- change the next Attack or Skill check by a player, if successful, to a critical success. If the roll is a failure, the Inspiration Point is wasted

## Potion use as a bonus action

Reduce the cost of using a potion on self to a bonus action. The use of a potion on another character would remain as an action.

## Improved advantage and disadvantage mechanics

Gaining advantage on a roll normally allows you to roll an additional d20, taking the highest value rolled. Instead of ignoring extra sources of advantage,like the rules as written do, advantage accumulates, with each advantageinstance stacking to givean additional +2 to the roll.


<b>Advantage Stacking</b>

| Sources of Advantage | Number of D20 to Roll | Additional Modifier |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 2 (keep highest) | - |
| 2 | 2 (keep highest) | +2 |
| 3 | 2 (keep highest) | +4 |
| 4 | 2 (keep highest) | +6 |

<i>Example</i>

Gaining advantage on a stealth check from a Cloak of Elvenkind as well as the Wood Elf's Mask of the Wildfeaturewould allow you to roll 2d20 for the cloak's advantage, and add +2 for the mask before adding your stealth modifier

## Easier Movement

Movement in any direction costs only 5 feet of
movement per square. This reduces the time tracking
diagonals during combat.

## The Interaction Action

During a player’s turn, they can use the Interaction to
perform one skill check for free. This promotes player
interaction with the environment during combat, without the
fear of potentially wasting a turn.

## Targeted Attacks

Players can aim for a specific area on their target for
a bonus effect upon success. Targeted attacks are made at
disadvantage. The bonus effect is in addition to the regular
damage of the attack.

<b>POTENTIAL TARGETED ATTACK EFFECTS</b>

| Area | Effect |
|:----:|:------:|
| Eye | Blinded |
| Wing | Flying speed reduced to 0 |
| Leg | Movement speed is halved |
| Arm / Hand | Drop items being carried |

Optionally, apply a damage threshold to each effect. The
effect will only take place if a certain threshold is reached.
The threshold value will vary widely depending on the type of
creature and the desired effect.

Any action or interaction that leaves you vulnerable
to be attacked triggers an opportunity attack from
enemies within melee range.

<i> Examples: </i>

Actions that would provoke an opportunity attack:

1. Standing up from prone
2. Drinking a potion
3. Loading a crossbow
4. Opening a door
5. Picking a lock
6. Using a complicated mechanism or puzzle
7. Casting a spell that has both somatic and material
components (This could be very taxing on some players, use with caution!).

## New Prone Condition

If an individual is knocked prone, they receive the prone
condition. Standing up from prone provokes opportunity
attacks from combatants within melee range.

## Modified Standing Up From Prone

Standing up from the prone position costs 15 feet of
movement, regardless of your total movement speed.

<i>This just makes sense to me; why should it cost 25 of the
Monk's 50 feet of movement but only 15 of the Paladin's 30
feet, who is in Heavy Armor?</i>

## Bloodied Conditions

Players and the DM cannot reveal exact hit points during combat. Instead, describe how wounded they are with three levels of the Bloodied condition.

<b>Bloodied Level Conditions</b>

| Level | Description |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| Bloodied | Character or creature is at 50% of max hit points |
| Well Bloodied | Character or creature is at 25% of max hit points |
| At Death’s Door | Character or creature is at 10% of max hit points |

## Convert Movement To Action

On your turn, you can spend 15ft of your available movement to complete a task. This could include tasks that would normally take a Bonus Action or Action.

- Actions that cost 15ft of movement
- Draw or sheathe a sword
- Open or close a door
- Withdraw a potion from your backpack
- Pick up a dropped weapon
- Pull a lever or a activate a switch
- Pull a torch from a sconce
- Turn a key in a lock
- Tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
- Hand an item to another character

## Throwing Creatures

As an action you can throw a creature that is one size smaller than yourself.

### If The Creature Is Friendly To You:

The thrower makes an athletics check and the creature being thrown makes an acrobatics check. Add the two results together to get the maximum number of feet they can be thrown. You may throw the creature any number of feet, up to this maximum.

If the thrower rolled higher than 10, you can round up the total to the nearest 5 (7 becomes 10, 13 becomes 15 etc.). If the creature being thrown rolls higher than 10, they land safely on their feet and don’t take any damage from losing balance. They take 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 5ft they were thrown otherwise.

### If The Creature Is An Enemy:

Before you can attempt to throw an enemy, you must have them grappled. The thrower makes an athletics check to determine how far you can throw them. If you throw them into a solid object, the thrown creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 5ft they would have been thrown. If you throw this creature into another creature, the damage is split evenly between them. The thrown creature can make a DC10 acrobatics check, taking half the damage on a success.

### If The Creature Is The Same Size As You:

You can follow the rules as above, but halve all of the results.

### If Two Creatures Are Throwing Together:

If two creatures are both throwing a single creature, they both need to be grappling that creature. Both throwers make athletics checks and the results are added together to determine how far it can be thrown. If the creature being thrown is friendly, it can also make an acrobatics check (as per the rule above).

## Glancing Blows

<b>When an attack roll exactly hits the target’s AC, it is called a glancing blow. A glancing blow deals half damage to the target.</b>

I like this rule because it gives another type of combat moment to describe at the table. Additionally, you could homebrew a monster and tweak this mechanic so that an entire range of its AC is a glancing blow. This would symbolize its armored hide or maybe the an extremely quick reaction speed. A large scaled creature might not be too difficult to hit so give it an AC of 15, but between 15 and 19 you would land a glancing blow for half damage. It would take a 20 or above to deal FULL damage. This is a great solution because it really sucks when players fight something with high AC and miss all the time, this lets em still feel like they are hacking this monster down.

## Learn new Feature and Skills (Variant DMG p.231)

A character who agrees to training as a reward must spend downtime with the trainer. In exchange, the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits include the following:

- The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 1d4 + 6 days.
- The character gains proficiency in a skill.
- The character gains a feat.

This is the official rule, BUT for obtain this you can have a max of 2 feat or skill learn on this way, if you want to learn a new one you must forgot one you already knew. And you must spend a bunch of days and gold with the master.
