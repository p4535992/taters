# 05 - House Rules - Compendium Attacks

## <b>Exceptional Success</b>

Any noncritical Attack Roll that beats AC by 10 or any Skill Roll that beats DC by 10 is considered Exceptional Success.

If your Attack is an Exceptional Success, you may reroll one weapon die before calculating the damage. You must use the new value even if it is lower.

If your Skill check is an Exceptional Success and is part of a task that involves another Skill check by the same or another character, that Skill check is rolled with advantage.

## <b>Initiative Rush</b>

At the end of your combat turn, you may announce that you want to rush your next turn. If you do so, raise your Initiative for the duration of the combat by 2 + Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1). On your next turn after rushing you experience the following effect:

- your first attack this turn is always at disadvantage
- movement speed is halved during the turn, rounded down
- bonus actions and class abilities can't be used this turn

## <b>Wounds</b>
