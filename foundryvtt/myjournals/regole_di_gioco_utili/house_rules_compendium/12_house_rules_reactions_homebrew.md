# 12 - House Rules - Reactions Homebrew

## [Giving Ground](https://www.brandesstoddard.com/2013/02/dd-next-design-idea-giving-ground/)

is a new reaction that all characters can use to reduce incoming melee damage by sacrificing position. 
As a reaction, whenever you take damage from a melee weapon attack or a weapon-like spell (such as flame blade), you may move five feet away from that attacker in order to reduce the damage of the attack by 1d6 hit points.
- The attacker has the immediate option to move five feet to follow, though if the attacker has caused more than one opponent to Give Ground in the same round of actions, she may follow only once.
- If none of the three squares behind the defender that increase his distance from the attacker are legal destinations, he may not Give Ground (even if he could otherwise pass through the square, such as when occupied by an ally).
- The defender also may not Give Ground to move into difficult terrain. Situationally, the DM may find it appropriate to allow a character to Give Ground with a move onto difficult terrain with a successful skill check (such as using Acrobatics to leap backward onto a table.)
- If for any reason the move backward fails, the defender does not reduce the incoming damage.
- A character may Give Ground in addition to being pushed, but not when knocked down, pulled, or teleported. The character must be able to move, and (obviously) must also be able to take reactions. 

<b>Varianr rule "togheter we fall" :</b>

- For each ally giving ground within 10 ft. from the defender the damage is reduced of another 1d6 for each ally.
- if you use Giving ground and the enemy make a natural 20 crit you got prone on the square five feet behind.

## [Lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfiw1SyQMk&feature=youtu.be)

if you use the reaction "Lucky", on the attack you substract the  proficiency, but on the damage you add the double of your profiniency 

<b>Esempio: </b>

<i>
if you have a dexterity proficiency by 3 and your weapon has “1d6” , you  attack with “1d6 – 3”, and if you succeded you make a “1d6+(2x3)” damage.
