# 01 - House Rules - Compendium Character Creation

## <b>Ingenious Proficiency</b>

Unless you are a spellcaster, Intelligence can be one of the least useful scores in Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. To remedy that, your cunning mind unlocks the potential to learn more skills and knowledge than others.

When creating a character, you gain a number of points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0). Subtract 2 if your class is capable of casting spells based on your Intelligence. These points can be spent on the table below.

### <b>Proficiency Costs</b>

| Benefit | Cost | 
|:-------:|:----:|
| Class or Background Skill proficiency | 2
| Double proficiency for a Skill you are proficient in | 3
| Language proficiency | 1
| Tool proficiency | 1
| Double proficiency for a Tool you are proficient with | 2
| Single Weapon proficiency | 1
| Right to choose Intelligence caster (sub)class later | 2

When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## <b>Option: Personality Profile</b>

A Personality Profile is a tool for players who are uncertain about what action their character should take. Whenever you aren't sure how your character would act or react, you can decide with a die roll plus a modifier based on your character's personality traits. <b>You do not have to follow the result of a personality check if you don't like it.</b> The DM may suggest a Personality check, but can't make you roll or abide to the result.

### <b>Creating a Personality Profile</b>

To fully sketch your character's personality, you may assign an advantage or disadvantage to any trait. You may assign double advantage or double disadvantage when certain traits are incredibly strong or devastatingly weak. As characters develop with time, you can change your profile at any point.

### <b>Personality Check</b>

When you want to check a certain personality trait, make an Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma check using the advantage or disadvantage (normal or double) assigned to the chosen trait. Then compare with DC in the Difficulty table. 

- Intelligence. Making a calm decision based on clearly understanding how your personality affects you and others, and whether the outcome benefits you.
- Wisdom. Resisting giving in to your emotions and personal urges, or making a choice between options while clouded by emotion, conflict, beliefs, or delusions.
- Charisma. Expressing your personality and emotions in a way that satisfies your urges, or affects others in a profoundly dramatic way.

| Difficulty | DC   |
|:----------:|:----:|
| Simple emotions. Easy to resist urges. Obvious decisions with few risks involved. | 10 |
| Strong emotions. Powerful urges. Challenging decisions with significant consequences. | 15 |
| Overwhelming emotions. All-consuming urges. Very difficult decisions with significant consequences for many, clouded by beliefs or delusions. | 20+ |
