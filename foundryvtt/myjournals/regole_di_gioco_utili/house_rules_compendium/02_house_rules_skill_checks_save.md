# 02 - House Rules - Skill/Check/Save

## <b>Exceptional Success</b>

Any noncritical Attack Roll that beats AC by 10 or any Skill Roll that beats DC by 10 is considered Exceptional Success.

If your Attack is an Exceptional Success, you may reroll one weapon die before calculating the damage. You must use the new value even if it is lower.

If your Skill check is an Exceptional Success and is part of a task that involves another Skill check by the same or another character, that Skill check is rolled with advantage.

## <b>Helping Others</b>

### Proficient Help Action
When you use the Help action to aid another character in a task, you must have proficiency in that Skill.

### Modificed "Help" Action
When taking the Help action, roll 1d6 and add your proficiency modifier. The person you are helping can add this number to their roll. If the roll is an attack, they can add this number to both the attack and damage rolls. You can rule that the Helper must be proficient in order to Help

## <b>Skill Check Retries</b>

When another player attempts a Skill check roll to gain new information (Perception, History, Arcana, etc.) from the DM and fails, you may attempt the same check only if you have a higher Skill modifier than theirs.
