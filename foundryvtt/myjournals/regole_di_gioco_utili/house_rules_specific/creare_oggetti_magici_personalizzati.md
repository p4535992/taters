# Create magical customize items

## Modify a magic item

The easiest way to customize a magical item could be to change the type of the structure without altering the magical nature, for example a paladin using a mace could change the sacred avenger, typically a sword, into a sacred avenger mace. Similarly, it is also possible to replace the nature of an already existing object, for example a tongue of fire sword could become a lightning tongue sword that would inflict electrical damage rather than fire. The magical properties could also be moved to a differently shaped object, such as a cloak of protection could be a circle of protection. Potions can also be replaced by new abilities, just as there is a potion of climbing, there may be a potion of figuration. Finally, it is possible to modify an object by merging multiple abilities into a single object, obviously the rarity of the object would increase, for example a helmet of telepathy and a helmet of understanding languages ​​could become a single helmet with both powers.

## <b>Create a magic item</b>

The most difficult way is certainly to create a magical object without any reference, in any case it is good to follow some guidelines regarding the limit of power that an object can contain, be it in the form of a bonus or spell.

### Power Level (Official)

If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your game. On the other hand. an item whose benefit rarely comes into play isn't much of a reward and probably not worth doling out as one.

Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide to help you determine how powerful an item should be, based on its rarity.

Macic Item Power by Rarity 

| Rarity | Max Spell Level | Max Bonus |
|:------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| Common | 1st | - |
| Uncommon | 3th | +1 |
| Rare | 6th | +2 |
| Very rare | 8th | +3 |
| Legendary | 9th | +4 |

<b>Maximum Spell Level.</b> This column of the table indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly timited property. For example. a common item might confer the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell more frequently.

<b>Maximum Bonus.</b> If an item delivers a static bonus to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the item's rarity.

### Attunement

A magical item doesn't necessarily have to be attuned, however in some it is a must. For example, if an item grants cumulative bonuses it must have attunement, or if, for example, that item can be traded between party members to earn benefits.

## <b>Duration and commitment in creation</b>

Chapter 6, “Between Adventures" in the Dungeon Master's Guide provides rules for crafting and selling magic items. However, many players have expressed dissatisfaction with the poor financial forecast in store for individuals who invest in this option. This document functions as a revision for the appropriate sections in the Dungeon Master's Guide to enable players to make better use of their downtime. It also introduces a new mechanic in the form of the magical workshop.

### <b>Magical Workshop</b>

Creating a magical item requires special tools. No ordinary hammer could forge a magical sword, and no ordinary furnace could temper the high quality steel needed for such a project. More advanced magical items require more well equipped workshops. Once a magical workshop has been established, it reduces future crafting costs, as the crafter does not have to re—invest in the infrastructure necessary to support their trade. Magical workshops have maintenance costs which include everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. When the workshop is not being used, the maintenance costs are halved, to a minimum of 25 gp per month.

#### <b>Building a magical workshop</b>

| Workshop | Construction Cost | Construction Time |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Common | 500 gp | 10 days |
| Uncommon | 1,000 gp | 30 days |
| Rare | 5,000 gp | 60 days |
| Very rare | 10,000 gp | 100 days |
| Legendary | 25,000 gp | 150 days |

#### <b>Maintenance costs</b>

| Workshop | Total Cost per Day| Skilled Hirelings |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Common | 2 gp | 1 |
| Uncommon | 5 gp | 1 |
| Rare | 10 gp | 2 |
| Very rare | 25 gp | 3 |
| Legendary | 50 gp | 4 |

### <b>Crafting a Magic Item</b>

The creation of a magic item is an expensive task. To start, a character must have proficiency in the type of tools required to craft an item of that type. To forge a magic sword requires proficiency with smith's tools, to brew a magical potion requires proficiency with an alchemist's kit, and so on. The character must also have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The rarity of such knowledge is up to the DM to decide, and they may determine that some formulae require special quests to discover.

In addition to these requirements, the character must be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items Items table.

#### <b>Crafting Magic Items</b>

| Item Rarity | Creation Cost | Minimum Level |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Common | 50 gp | 3rd |
| Uncommon | 250 gp | 3rd |
| Rare | 1,000 gp | 6th |
| Very rare | 5,000 gp | 11th |
| Legendary | 25,000 gp | 17th |

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable such as a potion or scroll) For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total creation cost not exceeding 25 gp. If the character is crafting the item in a workspace of the appropriate quality, as determined by the rarity of the item being crafted, the creation cost is reduced to half. A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress determined by an Intelligence check, including any proficiency bonus with the tools used in the craft. Hirelings or other characters that assist in this process can either grant the character advantage on the Intelligence check or contribute with their own, provided that they also have the necessary proficiency. The character spends an amount of gold determined by this check until the total creation cost of the item is paid, at which point the item is complete. The check is modified as follows:

<i><b>Progress</b> = (d20 + Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus) x 5 gp</i>

Thus, a 10th-1evel character with an Intelligence of 16 and proficiency in the necessary tools can make progress to a maximum of 135 gp per day, or 85 gp per day on average. Many items, such as weapons, require several days to physically create, regardless of the gold piece progress a character can make towards its completion. For example, even a master smith with a workshop full of apprentices could not produce a decent sword in fewer than two days. At the DM's discretion, a character might bypass such time requirements through the use of additional spells like fabricate.

While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, "Equipment", in the Player's Handbook)

### <b>Selling Magic Items</b>

Any settlement of moderate size can offer spellcasting services, including the sale of magic items. Most magical items are beyond the means of ordinary folk and require additional time and negotiation to procure or sell. A character in possession of such an item can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can’t be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure or quest.

For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic item table.

A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple magic items at once, although this requires multiple Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren’t added together. For example, if the character finds a buyer for a rare magic item in 2 days and a buyer for a separate rare magic item in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a very rare item up for grabs, the entire search takes 10 days.

For each item a character wishes to sell, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic Item table,

#### <b>Salable Magic Items</b>

| Item Rarity | Base Sale Price | Days to Find a Buyer | d100 Roll Modifier * |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Common | 100 gp | 1d4 | +10 |
| Uncommon | 500 gp | ld6 | +0 |
| Rare | 5,000 gp | 1d8 | -10 |
| Very rare | 50,000 gp | 1d10 | -20 |

<i>* Apply this modifier to rolls on the Selling a Magic Item table.</i>

| 61-80 | A buyer offering the full base price. |
| 81-90 | A buyer offering one and a half times the base price and a shady buyer offering twice the base price, no questions asked. |
| 91 or higher | A buyer offering twice the base price and a patron willing to offer you a commission to craft additional items. Consult your DM for details. |

applying a modifier based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic items table. The character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check and adds that checks total to the roll The subsequent total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item.

The DM determines a buyer’s identity. Buyers sometimes procure Rare and rarer items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the buyer is shady, it’s up to the DM whether the sale creates legal complications for the party later.
