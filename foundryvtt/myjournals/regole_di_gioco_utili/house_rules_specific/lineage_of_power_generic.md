## <b>Deities Hierarchy</b>

Each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:

### <b>Quasi-deities or hero deities.</b>

Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers. A category of weaker divine beings who don't grant spells to mortal clerics, but could advance to lesser deity if they had enough worshipers. This category is divided into three main subcategories:

- <b>Titans:</b> The offspring or creations of deities. Titans include the CR23 empyrean, the CR23 kraken, and the CR30 tarrasque.
- <b>Demigods:</b> The weakest of quasi-deities, the offspring of a deity and a mortal.
- <b>Vestiges:</b> A dead deity who has lost all or nearly all of their worshipers.

### <b>Demigods.</b>

They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.

### <b>Lesser deities.</b>

These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.

### <b>Intermediate deities.</b> 

These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.

### <b>Greater deities.</b>

These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.

### <b>Overdeities.</b>

These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.
